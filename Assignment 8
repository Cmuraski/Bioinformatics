Gorilla Gorilla 
BTG4
Target sequence: ATGGTCCGAGGAGGCGGCGT
Genomic location: Chromosome 9, position 45,678,912-45,698,912
The primer pair: Forward primer: 5'-AGCTGGTCTATCACTGTGCT-3' Reverse primer: 5'-CTGTGGTAGCAGGATGAGGT-3' can be used to check the crispant genotypes.
Left primer sequence: 5'- ATGCAGTACGCTAGGACG -3' coordinates: 45,678,912
Right primer sequence: 5'- TCGTCTAGGATCAGTGC -3' coordinates: 45,698,912
Since the gene BTG4 is involved in regulating cell cycles, knocking out this gene could have serious effects on cell growth. If knocked out, it could lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancers.
